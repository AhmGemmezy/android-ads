Banner RecyclerView Sample
============================================

This sample demonstrates how to request and display ads from AdMob Banner ads in an
Android application using the RecyclerView widget.

The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
This widget helps simplify the display and handling of large data sets by
allowing the layout manager to determine when to reuse (recycle) item views that
are no longer visible to the user. Recycling views improves performance by
avoiding the creation of unnecessary views or performing expensive
findViewByID() lookups.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Android API Level v14 or higher
- Android Build Tools v25 or higher
- Play Services Ads v11.8.0 or higher

How to Build
